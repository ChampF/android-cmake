CMake is great, and so is Android. This is a collection of CMake scripts, and
patches for common libraries that may be useful to the Android NDK community.
It is based on experience from porting OpenCV library to Android.

Main goal is to share these scripts so that devs that use CMake as their build
system may easily compile native code for Android.

Also, used by the OpenCV project: http://opencv.org/android
